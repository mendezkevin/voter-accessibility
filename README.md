<h3>**Problem situation**</h3>

The issue we plan on investigating is the lack of participation in elections, and specifically compare voter turnout in midterm and presidential elections. We believe that everyone living in the states such as taxpayers are stakeholders in voter participation because whoever is elected will play a large role in laws and policies that may or may not be passed that can affect our daily lives. In addition, people that are apart of marginalized communities are heavily impacted because when these groups are underrepresented or don’t exercise their right to vote, people who are elected into office generally don’t have diverse opinions or backgrounds.

<h3>**What is the problem?**</h3>

This is an issue because some people aren’t given the proper education on how important voting is whether it’s on the local, state, or federal level, because they may believe that their vote doesn’t count.  It has been shown that socioeconomic factors are associated with whether or not people grow the habit of voting which can include younger people not wanting to vote, cultural background, such as family members being citizens vs. naturalized, or even having family members incarcerated that no longer have a right to vote, which decreases the chance of family members voting. Overall when this happens, there is not a proper representation.
